# quizner
A very basic no-nonsense quiz and flash card application

## Road Map
1. Create a basic UI, namely the window, frame, and text areas for a flash card question and answer
2. Creae the basic actions to flip a card and move forward, backward, and random
3. Create parser for basic flash card DSL
4. Load .fcrd files and run them

### Stretch 
- Create quiz generation that will populate with wrong answers generated from a very small local llm
